Objective: The aim of this assignment is to help students understand the basics of web scraping with Selenium, a powerful tool for automating web browser interaction.
Rules: This is an individual assignment. You are allowed to discuss problems and ideas within your group. However, please keep in mind that you are not allowed to share this assignment with other students from your Section or other Sections.
Instructions: 
1. Complete this course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/selenium-essential-training 
2. Install Selenium. Students should first install Selenium WebDriver for their preferred browser 
(e.g. Chrome). They can do this by following the instructions on the official Selenium website. 
3. Choose a website to scrape according to your final project variant. Each team member must have a different website to scrape. 
4. Task 1. Students should use Selenium to write a Java code that will scrape the chosen website. 
Your program should do the following: 
✓ Open the website in a web browser using Selenium. 
✓ Find and interact with various elements on the page (e.g., links, buttons, text boxes) using Selenium commands.
✓ Extract data from the page using Selenium commands, such as finding and storing text, images, or other content.
✓ Save the scraped data in a CSV file or other format of your choice. 
5. Task 2. Students need to scrape multiple pages from the same website and combine the results.
6. Task 3. Students need to use advanced Selenium commands, such as waiting for elements to load or handling pop-up windows.
